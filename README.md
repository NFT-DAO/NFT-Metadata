# DAO NFT-Metadata

The Metadata thread (*subject/section ?*) of NFT DAO addresses xyz (*create a one or two sentence summary of this section*). 

This is a very rough draft of how a standard README.md of a repository of the NFT DAO github might look to new visitors. This is a shared document, please amend any errors and add content.

The only top-level file will be the README.md all other content will be in subject folders on this repository (*reword/remove/replace this sentence*).

Github supports relative weblinks ...
