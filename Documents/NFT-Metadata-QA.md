Here will live documentation of why this repository is laid out as it is. Evolving QA standards etc.

## Legacy content below

This is a very rough draft of how a standard README.md of a repository of the NFT DAO github might look to new visitors. 

This is a shared, open source document Apache-2.0 licence assumed (https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0), please amend any errors and add content.(*temporary/move to appropriate place*)

The only top-level file will be the README.md all other content will be in subject folders on this repository (*reword/remove/replace this sentence*).
